description: "This dataset contains the source data for Daume et al. (2024) \"Persistent
  activity during working memory maintenance predicts long-term memory formation in
  the human hippocampus\". Example code to analyze the data is deposited at Github
  (https://github.com/rutishauserlab/SBCAT-NO-release-NWB) and Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13621888).\n\nAbstract:\nWorking
  Memory (WM) and Long-Term Memory (LTM) are often viewed as separate cognitive  systems.
  \ Little  is  known  about  how  these  systems  interact  when  forming memories.
  We recorded single neurons in the human medial temporal lobe while patients maintained
  novel items in WM and a subsequent recognition memory test for the same items. In
  the hippocampus but not the amygdala, the level of WM content-selective persist
  activity during WM maintenance was predictive of whether the item was later recognized
  with high confidence or forgotten. In contrast, visually evoked activity in the
  same cells was not predictive of LTM formation. During LTM retrieval, memory-selective
  neurons responded more strongly to familiar stimuli for which persistent activity
  was high while they were maintained in WM. Our study suggests that hippocampal persistent
  activity of the same cell supports both WM maintenance and LTM encoding, thereby
  revealing a common single-neuron component of these two memory systems.\n\nNote:
  \nsub-35_ses-1_ecephys+image.nwb is missing waveform mean/std data, but they can
  be derived from the raw spike waveforms included in the file."
