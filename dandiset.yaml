description: 'Working Memory (WM) and Long-Term Memory (LTM) are often viewed as separate
  cognitive  systems.  Little  is  known  about  how  these  systems  interact  when  forming
  memories. We recorded single neurons in the human medial temporal lobe while patients
  maintained novel items in WM and a subsequent recognition memory test for the same
  items. In the hippocampus but not the amygdala, the level of WM content-selective
  persist activity during WM maintenance was predictive of whether the item was later
  recognized with high confidence or forgotten. In contrast, visually evoked activity
  in the same cells was not predictive of LTM formation. During LTM retrieval, memory-selective
  neurons responded more strongly to familiar stimuli for which persistent activity
  was high while they were maintained in WM. Our study suggests that hippocampal persistent
  activity of the same cell supports both WM maintenance and LTM encoding, thereby
  revealing a common single-neuron component of these two memory systems.


  Note: sub-35_ses-1 is missing waveform mean/std data, but they can be derived from
  the raw spike waveforms included in the file.'
